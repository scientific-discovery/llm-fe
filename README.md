# LLEMA: Accelerating Materials Design via LLM-Guided Evolutionary Search

## About

LLM-FE is a general framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as intelligent feature engineers for tabular machine learning tasks. The method reframes feature engineering as a language-driven generation and refinement process, enabling LLMs to propose, explain, and iteratively improve high-quality features that enhance downstream predictive performance.

## Key Features

- **LLM-Driven Feature Generation:** Uses natural language prompts to generate diverse and semantically meaningful feature transformations
- **Model-in-the-Loop Refinement:** Iteratively improves features based on downstream model performance feedback
- **Task-Agnostic Design:** Applicable across regression and classification tasks on structured/tabular data
- **Explainable Features:** Produces human-interpretable feature definitions expressed in natural language
- **Plug-and-Play Pipeline:** Integrates seamlessly with standard machine learning models and workflows

## Results

LLM-FE demonstrates that:
- ✅ LLM-generated features consistently improve predictive performance over raw features
- ✅ Performance is competitive with or superior to expert-crafted and automated feature engineering baselines
- ✅ The framework generalizes across datasets, domains, and learning objectives
- ✅ Generated features are interpretable, reusable, and aligned with domain semantics
